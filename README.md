# Performing analysis on trading data
## Overview of Project
Client wants to invest and understand the market of the energy industry.
### Purpose
The purpose of this stock analysis is to provide key insights to the client and guide them in building their investment portfolio. The parameter to measure and determine which company is worth investing in is the yearly return, it compares the stock price at the beginning of the year with the last price available. With this comparison it is possible to know if the companyâ€™s stock grew or shrunk.

The industry performed extremely well during 2017, all companies registered increments in their stock prices except for TERP. Nonetheless, the results show that 2018 was a complicated year for the industry, only two companies registered growth and the rest shrunk. Considering the behaviour of the market it is recommended to invest in ENPH and/or RUN which yield over 80% increment, which continued with a positive trend. Despite the clients' initial interest in DQ it is highly recommended to avoid buying their stock since the price dropped 62.6% during 2018.

## Summary
Code refactoring has several benefits, it is possible to improve the performance of the program as well as it's simplicity. Refactoring can be a source of peer review if the person who does it did not write the original code, thus fixing some bugs or apply best practices. However, it can be a source for bugs specially if deadlines are near. Additionally, it can take longer times to understand and refactor the original code rather than rewriting it from scratch. Unless necessary for maintainability and performance purposes if the code is not broken do not touch it.

For this analysis, the refactoring significantly improved the efficiency of the code. Considering that the analysis can be repeated with a bigger dataset this improvement allows us to complete it without consuming the computer's resources. In other words, it allows us to run the program with certainty that it will not freeze or crash due to memory overflow.
